    "for each of the encoded hidden state in the context of a particular\n",
    "decoder hidden state in each timestep - all to determine which encoded hidden\n",
    "states to attend to for a particular decoder hidden state context.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, I am here implementing local attention as opposed to global attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "I already mentioned local attention before. Local attention mechanism involves focusing on\n",
    "a subset of encoded hidden states, whereas a gloabl attention mechanism invovles focusing on all\n",
    "the encoded hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the paper on which this implementation is based on:\n",
    "https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/emnlp15_attn.pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "Following the formulas presented in the paper, first, I am computing\n",
    "the position pt (the center of the window of attention).\n",
    "\n",
    "pt is simply a position in the sequence.\n",
    "For a given pt, the model will only consider the hidden state starting from the position\n",
    "pt-D to the hidden state at the position pt+D. \n",
    "\n",
    "To say a hidden state is at position p, I mean to say that the hidden state is the encoded\n",
    "representation of a word at position p in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper formulates the equation for calculating pt like this:\n",
    "pt = sequence_length x sigmoid(..some linear algebras and activations...)\n",
    "\n",
    "But, I didn't used the sequence_length of the whole text which is tf_seq_len but 'positions' which\n",
    "is = tf_seq_len-1-2D\n",
    "\n",
    "if pt = tf_seq_len x sigmoid(tensor)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then pt will be in the range 0 to tf_seq_len\n",
    "\n",
    "But, we can't have that. There is no tf_seq_len position. Since the length is tf_seq_len,\n",
    "the available positions are 0 to (tf_seq_len-1). Which is why I subtracted 1 from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we must have the value of pt to be such that it represents the CENTER of the window.\n",
    "If pt is too close to 0, pt-D will be negative - a non-existent position.\n",
    "If pt is too close to tf_seq_len, pt+D will be a non-existent position.\n",
    "\n",
    "So pt can't occupy the first D positions (0 to D-1) and it can't occupy the last D positions\n",
    "((tf_seq_len-D) to (tf_seq_len-1)) in order to keep pt-D and pt+D as legal positions.\n",
    "So a total 2D positions should be restricted to pt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is why I further subtracted 2D from tf_seq_len.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, after calculating pt = positions x sigmoid(tensor)\n",
    "where positions = tf_seq_len-(2D+1), \n",
    "pt will merely range between 0 to tf_seq_len-(2D+1)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't still accept pt to be 0 since pt-D will be negative. But the length of the range \n",
    "of integer positions pt can occupy is now perfect.\n",

    "Now, it can be checked that pt+D, or pt-D will never become negative or exceed\n",

    "Which is why I defined (in past) a MAX_LEN, and transformed target outputs in\n",
    "the form \"word1 word2 word3....eos <PAD> <PAD>....until max_length\"\n",
    "I created the model output in the same way.\n",
